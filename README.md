# Trip-app.py

This code defines three functions that could be used for a trip planning application.

The "trip_planner_welcome()" function prints a welcome message to the user, including their name.

The "estimated_time_rounded()" function takes an estimated travel time as input and rounds it to the nearest integer.

The "destination_setup()" function takes four arguments - origin, destination, estimated_time, and mode_of_transport - and prints a message to the user indicating the details of their trip, including the mode of transport they will be using and the estimated travel time.

Finally, the code calls the "destination_setup()" function with some example arguments, which produces a message to the user indicating that their trip starts in Ukraine, ends in Spain, and will take approximately 3 hours by plane.

Overall, this code demonstrates how multiple functions can be defined and called to perform different tasks within an application, and how function arguments can be used to customize the behavior of the functions.
